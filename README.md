# Memrise Catch Up Review

Userscript which fast-tracks the growth level of any words that have been left for too long but are still reviewed correctly.

### Installation

The easiest method is through an extension/add-on on chrome/firefox:

- Chrome: install the [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) extension
- Firefox: install the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) add-on

Then add the script using the following link: https://github.com/cooljingle/memrise-catch-up-review/raw/master/Memrise_Catch_Up_Review.user.js
